LLNux PostInstall
===================================

An Ubuntu post-installation script launched just after an fresh installation by Louvain-li-Nux users 

Firstly, thank you to Alin Andrei from WebUpd8 for the idea and the first implementation of this script.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply download the content and double click on 'ubuntu-12.04-matttbe-mirror' / Launch from a Terminal.

Please note that messages of this script are in French but translations from the previous version (10.10 is still available on webupd8) ;)

Also, with the default options you'll use our local Ubuntu mirror...


I want to add / change something 
--------------------------------

You are welcome! Fork this repository ;)
